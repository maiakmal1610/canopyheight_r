**Project Title**: Canopy Height Modeling from LiDAR-Derived Rasters using R

**Overview**:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for generating a canopy height model from LiDAR-derived rasters using the R programming language. The project is part of a guided tutorial by National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) in which the data provided information on NEON's San Joaquin Experimental Range and Soaproot Saddle field sites.

The goal of this project is to visualize raw LiDAR data in .las format and generating a canopy height model to understand forest structure and dynamics.
